Extra Long Factorials
The factorial of the integer , written , is defined as:

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if , we calculate  and get .

Function Description

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer
Note: Factorials of  can't be stored even in a  long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

Input Format

Input consists of a single integer
