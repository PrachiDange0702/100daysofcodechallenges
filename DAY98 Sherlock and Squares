/*
Sherlock and Squares
Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value that describe a range of integers, inclusive of the endpoints. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range.

Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. .

Example


There are three square integers in the range:  and . Return .

Function Description

Complete the squares function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from  to .

squares has the following parameter(s):

int a: the lower range boundary
int b: the upper range boundary
Returns

int: the number of square integers in the range
Input Format

The first line contains , the number of test cases.
Each of the next  lines contains two space-separated integers,  and , the starting and ending integers in the ranges.
